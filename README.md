## Project: [JBA-Jv] JSON Database
In this project I go back to the basic: learn the basics of web communication via sockets.  I wil learn to create a client-server application that allows clients to store data on hte server in JSON format.


### Project Description
JSON is a ubiquitous format for exchanging data between web servers and browsers.  Its simple design and flexibility make it easy to understand and use in the programming language of your choice.  You will create a client-server application that allows the clients to store their data on the server in JSON format.


### Learning Outcomes
You will get a firm grasp of working with JSON in Java.  You will also practice parallelization and see how to implement processing multiple requests at the same time.
